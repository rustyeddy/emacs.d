Our intention is to have an RFID transceiver in a plastic &amp;amp; metal enclosure that can detect a tag embedded in a plastic component where the transceiver will passively power the tag to read and subsequently write event-based usage information on both local memory and the tag. We plan to integrate this hardware and firmware into our system.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br />
- System must have contactless interface<br />
- Tag cost must be passively powered, on a flexible substrate, and lower than $2/tag<br />
- RFID transceiver must be able to operate through aluminum sheet metal at a distance &amp;lt;4&amp;quot; (likely an LF RFID system)<br />
- Tags must have a security feature to reduce unwanted or unintended interrogation/overwrite (there are quite a few password protected or encrypted tags)<br />
- Preference for open source software (preferably GUI based but not required)<br />
- Must be able to modify usage reporting logging (as changes will probably be needed at some point) <br />
- Antenna can ideally fit within a 1.75&amp;quot; diameter circle but not a hard constraint<br />
- Preference for Arduino based prototype<br /><br />

I want to make the wheelchair where it is hooked up to a analog joystick and I can switch it over to a wireless joystick using a RF signal on 2.4 GHz frequency. For this I have a Arduino Uno and a shield that goes on top of it called a Funduino&nbsp;&nbsp;that has a joystick and buttons that can be programmed. I also have a nRF24 transceiver that plugs into the top of the Funduino to allow for wireless communication to the receiver which is also a nRF24 receiver.

INTRO<br /><br />
We are looking to publish at least one new article (~500 words) to our blog every month ($100/article &mdash; negotiable). Feel free to look at our blog right now to get a feel for what we write about: https://medium.com/jaycon-systems<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THE COMPANY<br /><br />
We are a product design and manufacturing company. We design hardware products (mostly consumer electronics), prototype them, and also manufacture them. Here are some of the things we do in our company (and the things we would like to write about):<br /><br />
- Electrical engineering (IoT, motors &amp;amp; sensors, FPGAs, Arduino &amp;amp; Raspberry pi, etc)<br />
- Mechanical engineering (CAD modeling)<br />
- Industrial design (ergonomics, aesthetics) <br />
- Prototyping (resin casting, 3D printing, CNC Machining, painting)<br />
- PCB fabrication &amp;amp; PCB assembly (component sourcing, stencil, pick and place machine)<br />
- Electrical engineering (breadboard prototyping, schematics and BOMs)<br />
- Firmware programming (Bluetooth, debuggers, cryptography, etc)<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THIS JOB<br /><br />
Ultimately we are looking for someone (or more than one person due to the variety of services we offer) to write content related to all these services listed above. Our target market is usually the ME or EE engineer that works within a company (we want their company to become our client), so it's important that the content is somewhat technical but very informative and relevant. Every once in a while we will be writing content focused on entrepreneurship and not to the engineers &mdash; in that case the target market will be entrepreneurs, inventors and business-minded engineers who want to create their own product and bring it to market.<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
TOPICS<br /><br />
The topics are usually open (we are open to suggestions from the writer) unless we have something in mind based on a recent occurrence at our company (such as an interaction with a customer or a manufacturing problem we encountered and how to mitigate it). We could talk about a new technology, about a process, highlight a customer or make a case study, etc &mdash; like I said, we are very open to new topics. <br /><br />
Here are some possible topics we have not written about:<br />
- Manufacturing failure rate: What is acceptable and what is not<br />
- Injection molding &mdash; Do this not that: Straight pull vs. Cam<br />
- How and why to protect my idea/IP if I have a new product idea<br />
- Product teardowns (reverse engineering)<br />
- How to optimize your board schematics for manufacturing<br />
- Cheapest ways to prototype electronics<br /><br /><br />

We are looking mostly for 3rd person writing but find that 2nd person can be acceptable when writing about entrepreneurship. Our articles will be mostly informational and we will be adding a boilerplate that talks about Jaycon and maybe persuade them into going to our website. We would like a few keywords for SEO to be used throughout the article. Links to previous blog posts we have published and/or to our services throughout the article are a must.<br /><br />
The process is easy &mdash; we get in touch with you and let you know if we have any topics in mind. At this time you are also welcome to suggest topics based on some quick research you may want to do. You jump in a call with the marketing manager and/or engineer and they can explain better what they have in mind for that specific article. Before writing, if you could propose an outline, that would be superb so we know if the flow of the article aligns with what we have in mind. Then you're welcome to start writing!<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $100

We are looking to publish at least one new article (~500 words) to our blog every month ($100/article &mdash; negotiable). Feel free to look at our blog right now to get a feel for what we write about: https://medium.com/jaycon-systems<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THE COMPANY<br /><br />
We are a product design and manufacturing company. We design hardware products (mostly consumer electronics), prototype them, and also manufacture them. Here are some of the things we do in our company (and the things we would like to write about):<br /><br />
- Electrical engineering (IoT, motors &amp;amp; sensors, FPGAs, Arduino &amp;amp; Raspberry pi, etc)<br />
- Mechanical engineering (CAD modeling)<br />
- Industrial design (ergonomics, aesthetics) <br />
- Prototyping (resin casting, 3D printing, CNC Machining, painting)<br />
- PCB fabrication &amp;amp; PCB assembly (component sourcing, stencil, pick and place machine)<br />
- Electrical engineering (breadboard prototyping, schematics and BOMs)<br />
- Firmware programming (Bluetooth, debuggers, cryptography, etc)<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THIS JOB<br /><br />
Ultimately we are looking for someone (or more than one person due to the variety of services we offer) to write content related to all these services listed above. Our target market is usually the ME or EE engineer that works within a company (we want their company to become our client), so it&#039;s important that the content is somewhat technical but very informative and relevant. Every once in a while we will be writing content focused on entrepreneurship and not to the engineers &mdash; in that case the target market will be entrepreneurs, inventors and business-minded engineers who want to create their own product and bring it to market.<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
TOPICS<br /><br />
The topics are usually open (we are open to suggestions from the writer) unless we have something in mind based on a recent occurrence at our company (such as an interaction with a customer or a manufacturing problem we encountered and how to mitigate it). We could talk about a new technology, about a process, highlight a customer or make a case study, etc &mdash; like I said, we are very open to new topics. <br /><br />
Here are some possible topics we have not written about:<br />
- Manufacturing failure rate: What is acceptable and what is not<br />
- Injection molding &mdash; Do this not that: Straight pull vs. Cam<br />
- How and why to protect my idea/IP if I have a new product idea<br />
- Product teardowns (reverse engineering)<br />
- How to optimize your board schematics for manufacturing<br />
- Cheapest ways to prototype electronics<br /><br /><br />

We plan to integrate this hardware and firmware into our system.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br />
- System must have contactless interface<br />
- Tag cost must be passively powered, on a flexible substrate, and lower than $2/tag<br />
- RFID transceiver must be able to operate through aluminum sheet metal at a distance &amp;lt;4&amp;quot; (likely an LF RFID system)<br />
- Tags must have a security feature to reduce unwanted or unintended interrogation/overwrite (there are quite a few password protected or encrypted tags)<br />
- Preference for open source software (preferably GUI based but not required)<br />
- Must be able to modify usage reporting logging (as changes will probably be needed at some point) <br />
- Antenna can ideally fit within a 1.75&amp;quot; diameter circle but not a hard constraint<br />
- Preference for Arduino based prototype<br /><br />

I want to make the wheelchair where it is hooked up to a analog joystick and I can switch it over to a wireless joystick using a RF signal on 2.4 GHz frequency. For this I have a Arduino Uno and a shield that goes on top of it called a Funduino&nbsp;&nbsp;that has a joystick and buttons that can be programmed. I also have a nRF24 transceiver that plugs into the top of the Funduino to allow for wireless communication to the receiver which is also a nRF24 receiver. Below is a link to the Funduino shield.<br /><br />

I am looking for a electrical engineer that would enjoy working on a project like this and completing it in a timely manner. Please give me a timeline of how long you think something like this would take. I do not anticipate it taking any more than 2 to 3 weeks. As far as other things such as the coding required for the Arduino is not required for this job it would be done by myself.

INTRO<br /><br />
We are looking to publish at least one new article (~500 words) to our blog every month ($100/article &mdash; negotiable). Feel free to look at our blog right now to get a feel for what we write about: https://medium.com/jaycon-systems<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THE COMPANY<br /><br />
We are a product design and manufacturing company. We design hardware products (mostly consumer electronics), prototype them, and also manufacture them. Here are some of the things we do in our company (and the things we would like to write about):<br /><br />
- Electrical engineering (IoT, motors &amp;amp; sensors, FPGAs, Arduino &amp;amp; Raspberry pi, etc)<br />
- Mechanical engineering (CAD modeling)<br />
- Industrial design (ergonomics, aesthetics) <br />
- Prototyping (resin casting, 3D printing, CNC Machining, painting)<br />
- PCB fabrication &amp;amp; PCB assembly (component sourcing, stencil, pick and place machine)<br />
- Electrical engineering (breadboard prototyping, schematics and BOMs)<br />
- Firmware programming (Bluetooth, debuggers, cryptography, etc)<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
ABOUT THIS JOB<br /><br />
Ultimately we are looking for someone (or more than one person due to the variety of services we offer) to write content related to all these services listed above. Our target market is usually the ME or EE engineer that works within a company (we want their company to become our client), so it&#039;s important that the content is somewhat technical but very informative and relevant. Every once in a while we will be writing content focused on entrepreneurship and not to the engineers &mdash; in that case the target market will be entrepreneurs, inventors and business-minded engineers who want to create their own product and bring it to market.<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
TOPICS<br /><br />
The topics are usually open (we are open to suggestions from the writer) unless we have something in mind based on a recent occurrence at our company (such as an interaction with a customer or a manufacturing problem we encountered and how to mitigate it). We could talk about a new technology, about a process, highlight a customer or make a case study, etc &mdash; like I said, we are very open to new topics. <br /><br />
Here are some possible topics we have not written about:<br />
- Manufacturing failure rate: What is acceptable and what is not<br />
- Injection molding &mdash; Do this not that: Straight pull vs. Cam<br />
- How and why to protect my idea/IP if I have a new product idea<br />
- Product teardowns (reverse engineering)<br />
- How to optimize your board schematics for manufacturing<br />
- Cheapest ways to prototype electronics<br /><br /><br />

EXAMPLES:<br /><br />
Example of some blog posts we love:<br />
1) https://blog.bolt.io/no-you-cant-manufacture-that-like-apple-does-93bea02a3bbf<br />
2) https://www.fictiv.com/blog/posts/practical-guide-to-prototype-testing<br />
3) Our own blog medium.com/jaycon-systems<br /><br /><br />
_ _ _ <br />
WRITING<br /><br />
We are looking mostly for 3rd person writing but find that 2nd person can be acceptable when writing about entrepreneurship. Our articles will be mostly informational and we will be adding a boilerplate that talks about Jaycon and maybe persuade them into going to our website. We would like a few keywords for SEO to be used throughout the article. Links to previous blog posts we have published and/or to our services throughout the article are a must.<br /><br />
The process is easy &mdash; we get in touch with you and let you know if we have any topics in mind. At this time you are also welcome to suggest topics based on some quick research you may want to do. You jump in a call with the marketing manager and/or engineer and they can explain better what they have in mind for that specific article. Before writing, if you could propose an outline, that would be superb so we know if the flow of the article aligns with what we have in mind. Then you&#039;re welcome to start writing!<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $100
