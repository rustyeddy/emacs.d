Zagreb Croatia. Optional skills Java Spring Boot, Android, IOS - Upwork" "Freelancer role - front end Angular developer Zagreb / Croatia.<br /><br />
Good understanding of HTML / CSS3 / Angular2+<br /><br />
Good skills in TypeScript, Javascript (though as much as possible all implementation to be done in TypeScript)<br /><br />
You should be able to use your combined skills to take creative designs generated from SketchApp and synthesise a front end Angular 6 application using best practice in HTML, CSS and Angular. We normally base our application skeletons on popular starter apps in github to keep the increasingly complex build configuration up to date. Our server side devs will define a REST API, from which a typescript interface will be defined, and a mock implementation will be maintained returning locally generated mock data. This will allow you to develop the site independently from the back end if required, yet switch over when the time is right without any code changes. You will be working with an international team distributed around the world, including Australia.<br /><br />
Ideally you will be able to show us your code repo or live applications to demonstrate your capabilities.<br /><br />
Additional beneficial skills, (though not necessary for this particular role) would be:<br /><br />
Mobile development - IOS, Android<br />
Lightweight server side Java development - Spring Boot, Kotlin.<br /><br />
Our decades of experience in enterprise fintech have led us to the decision to centre our entire development stack on strongly typed languages, such as typescript, java, kotlin, golang, and sometimes C++, which does buck recent trends somewhat. Once code complexity reaches a certain threshold, in our opinion dynamic languages become a liability. We also maintain a limited 'ordained technology' list to allow our developers to attain a higher level of expertise as well as more comfortably transition onto other projects.<br /><br />
The organisation is doing interesting and challenging work in areas of e-money, mobile payments, stored value smart card technology, trading, cryptocurrency related and other distributed ledger applications, machine learning. Many of our application are of a very critical nature, so clean, robust implementation is paramount. One of our areas of expertise is ultra high throughput systems - non blocking systems capable of millions of durable transactions per second on non exotic hardware. This is a somewhat niche field that uses techniques not common in standard corporate three tier apps - if you're familiar with the area you would be aware of the various libraries Martin Thomson has been involved developing.<br /><br />
We are opening offices in eastern Europe, one of the first being Zagreb. Ideal candidate will live in or near Zagreb so occasional face to face interaction in our Zagreb office is possible.<br /><br />
We hope to be in eastern Europe for the long term, and are working through an appropriate growth strategy.<br /><br />
We have a results based outlook - great flexibility will be offered to the candidate who can demonstrate productive work with our existing team. Rate, hours etc all negotiable depending on candidate.<br /><br />

Payment gateway to integrate is SecurionPay: you should register in it to get demo-account for testing.<br /><br />
I would like to get a code in GitHub pull requests, they will be reviewed. Communication through Telegram messenger. The ideal way to do work is to make pull requests once a day.<br /><br />

The project consists of 3 microservices:<br />
1. API: written in go, 12 kLoC<br />
2. Queue worker: written in go, 4 kLoC<br />
3. Web: react, redux, typescript, node.js (SSR) 3 kLoC<br /><br />
Each microservice has README with documentation on how to develop, run and test it. I can help you at any time with the configuration of your environment and any problems launching them.<br /><br />
To implement the feature you need to change only API microservice.<br />
I have a detailed specification for the development: which API to implement, which tables to add to a database. But I could not take into account some details, therefore you should also ensure that the whole feature (subscribe to a paid plan by card) works ok.<br /><br />
Deadline is 2 weeks with 3-4 milestones. Estimated work hours are 30.<br /><br />

Good understanding of HTML / CSS3 / Angular2+<br /><br />
Good skills in TypeScript, Javascript (though as much as possible all implementation to be done in TypeScript)<br /><br />
You should be able to use your combined skills to take creative designs generated from SketchApp and synthesise a front end Angular 6 application using best practice in HTML, CSS and Angular. We normally base our application skeletons on popular starter apps in github to keep the increasingly complex build configuration up to date. Our server side devs will define a REST API, from which a typescript interface will be defined, and a mock implementation will be maintained returning locally generated mock data. This will allow you to develop the site independently from the back end if required, yet switch over when the time is right without any code changes. You will be working with an international team distributed around the world, including Australia.<br /><br />
Ideally you will be able to show us your code repo or live applications to demonstrate your capabilities.<br /><br />
Additional beneficial skills, (though not necessary for this particular role) would be:<br /><br />
Mobile development - IOS, Android<br />
Lightweight server side Java development - Spring Boot, Kotlin.<br /><br />
Our decades of experience in enterprise fintech have led us to the decision to centre our entire development stack on strongly typed languages, such as typescript, java, kotlin, golang, and sometimes C++, which does buck recent trends somewhat. Once code complexity reaches a certain threshold, in our opinion dynamic languages become a liability. We also maintain a limited &#039;ordained technology&#039; list to allow our developers to attain a higher level of expertise as well as more comfortably transition onto other projects.<br /><br />
The organisation is doing interesting and challenging work in areas of e-money, mobile payments, stored value smart card technology, trading, cryptocurrency related and other distributed ledger applications, machine learning. Many of our application are of a very critical nature, so clean, robust implementation is paramount. One of our areas of expertise is ultra high throughput systems - non blocking systems capable of millions of durable transactions per second on non exotic hardware. This is a somewhat niche field that uses techniques not common in standard corporate three tier apps - if you&#039;re familiar with the area you would be aware of the various libraries Martin Thomson has been involved developing.<br /><br />
We are opening offices in eastern Europe, one of the first being Zagreb. Ideal candidate will live in or near Zagreb so occasional face to face interaction in our Zagreb office is possible.<br /><br />
We hope to be in eastern Europe for the long term, and are working through an appropriate growth strategy.<br /><br />
We have a results based outlook - great flexibility will be offered to the candidate who can demonstrate productive work with our existing team. Rate, hours etc all negotiable depending on candidate.<br /><br />
If you don&#039;t necessarily have the demonstrable work experience but you are interested, motivated and believe you have what it takes - reach out anyway.<br /><br />

Good understanding of HTML / CSS3 / Angular2+<br /><br />
Good skills in TypeScript, Javascript (though as much as possible all implementation to be done in TypeScript)<br /><br />
You should be able to use your combined skills to take creative designs generated from SketchApp and synthesise a front end Angular 6 application using best practice in HTML, CSS and Angular. We normally base our application skeletons on popular starter apps in github to keep the increasingly complex build configuration up to date. Our server side devs will define a REST API, from which a typescript interface will be defined, and a mock implementation will be maintained returning locally generated mock data. This will allow you to develop the site independently from the back end if required, yet switch over when the time is right without any code changes. You will be working with an international team distributed around the world, including Australia.<br /><br />
Ideally you will be able to show us your code repo or live applications to demonstrate your capabilities.<br /><br />
