1.1 What is it?
===============

Notes-mode is an indexing system for on-line note-taking.  Notes-mode
is composed of two parts, the visible part, a major-mode for emacs to
aid note-taking; and the invisible part, scripts which periodically
index your notes for you.

   Note that notes-mode provides tools to "index" your notes, not to
"search" them.  (Other existing tools such as `grep', `agrep', and
`glimpse' already allow file search.)

   A digression about indexing vs. searching: Indexing in this sense
means organize them according to categories you give, while searching
looks through all text for arbitrary strings.  Drawing on the World
Wide Web for examples, Yahoo (`http://www.yahoo.com/') is an index,
while Alta Vista (`http://www.altavista.digital.com/') is a
search-engine.  In (potentially) more familiar terms, the yellow pages
(1) are an index, while directory information (411 in the USA) is sort
of a search-engine.

1.2 Why keep notes at all?
==========================

So why should you use notes-mode?  Well, first, consider why you should
(perhaps) keep your notes on line.  First, I assume that you take notes
as part of your work or school.  If you don't, you can stop reading now
and go back to watching TV.

   If you keep notes, ask yourself why you keep them.  Reasons vary for
different people, but some include:

   * To remember what is said or done.

   * To focus on what is important about what is said.

   * To provide proof of having done something at a particular time or
     date.

   * I know there were other reasons here, but they slipped my mind.


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Why keep notes on-line?,  Next: Why use notes-mode?,  Prev: Why keep notes at all?,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Why keep notes on-line?
===========================

OK, I've talked you into keeping notes.  Why do it on-line?  Again,
there are different reasons for different people.  If you don't want to
consider keeping your notes on-line, you're welcome to go back to your
(clay tablets) paper notes.

   However, if you do much of your work on-line, or if you have
portable computer, then you might want to consider keeping your notes
on-line.

   * It's faster to type than write, and possibly more legible at high
     speed.

   * Often information is already on-line.  For example, in software
     development, bug reports, measurement results, and everything else
     that's useful is on-line.

   * You can take down more detail than you otherwise would (especially
     if the data is already on-line).  Taking more copious notes can be
     helpful when you go back to figure out why that strange thing was
     happening.

   * On-line notes are easy to search.  Full-text search with grep,
     agrep, and glimpse are all much faster and are often more accurate
     than paging through paper notes looking for a particular keyword.

   * On-line notes are easy to index.  (At least with notes-mode!)  In
     addition to full-text search, it's helpful to organize notes by
     category.  If you keep a table-of-contents of your paper notes,
     you are either extremely fastidious or a librarian (Nadia?).

   * You can keep all of your notes with you at all times (if you have
     a portable computer).  Even at a page a day, paper notes quickly
     become bulky and awkward to carry around.  On-line notes fit on
     your computer's hard disk, an extraordinarily compact medium by
     comparison.

   * Your notes can be automatically backed up.  Paper notes can become
     damaged with time, and as a graduate student one of my fears was
     fire in Boelter Hall consuming all my research experiments and and
     therefore hopes of a degree.  Electronic notes are extremely easy
     to duplicate and can be automatically backed up with the rest of
     your computer.  (You _do_ back up your computer, don't you?)


   While these advantages are undoubtedly clear to any right-thinking
computer user, it should be said that there are a few disadvantages for
on-line note-taking.

   * If you don't have a computer with you most of the time, it's
     difficult take notes on-line (because you're off-line, of course).
     (1)

   * Computers require power.  If your portable computer runs out of
     juice, you're on your own.  Corollary:  watch your power, or bring
     paper.  Better corollary:  watch your power, _and_ bring paper.

   * Social limitations.  It's not always socially acceptable to take
     notes-on-line.  For example, at a party, few people would use a
     computer to take down the phone number of a person to whom they're
     attracted (at least, if they wanted the attraction to be mutual).
     (2) Sometimes other people find the sound of typing distracting.

   * Health issues.  Repetitive stress injuries do occur writing
     (slower) by hand is at least an alternate motion than typing.

   * Legal limitations.  If you want to use your electronic notes to
     justify a patent or invention, you may be breaking legal ground.
     Being on the legal cutting-edge is rarely an easy thing for the
     person involved.(3)


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) I consider myself pretty anal about this subject, often typing
notes in from paper after-the-fact, and _I_ certainly don't manage to
back-enter my notes all time time.

   (2) On the other hand, some folks at MIT are working on this problem
from both the hardware and the social side of things
(`http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/') (Perhaps
they have wild parties with computers, too.)

   (3) My hat is off to Rosa Parks and the many other normal people who
triggered landmark cases.

1.4 Why use notes-mode?
=======================

OK, I've sold you on note-taking and even on on-line note-taking.  What
about notes-mode?  Naturally, it slices, dices, and makes julienne
fries.  But wait, there's more:

   * It automates indexing your notes, linking notes with the same
     subject together.

   * It supports embedded links, allowing you to manually link together
     different topics and external files.

   * It includes a number of convenience-features in emacs.  Subjects
     can be completed based on existing subjects.  The usual emacs
     customization mechanisms are available.

   * Notes containing sensitive information can be encrypted.

   * Notes-mode seems better than the other, currently available
     alternatives.

   What are the alternatives?  I'm glad you asked.  (1)

   * *HTML*.  HTML has better formatting capabilities than notes-mode,
     and it has excellent linking capabilities.  Unfortunately, HTML's
     tags are fairly intrusive  (each is at least four characters long
     and most come with a pair),  tags can get confused with normal
     text,  errors in HTML can be bad (obscuring data),  and there's no
     automatic indexing feature  (at least with plain HTML).  Besides,
     all data should be kept as close to the ASCII from whence it came,
     as God Intended (hi, Steve).

   * *Word Processors*.  Word processors are strong in the formatting
     department,  but most don't really have linking capabilities,  and
     have poor or restricted indexing.

File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Y2K Statement,  Next: Related work,  Prev: Why use notes-mode?,  Up: Introduction

1.5 Y2K Statement
=================

Notes mode uses dates extensively,  both two-digit years and
seconds-since-1970.  However, notes-mode has been coded to function
correctly through  the year 2038.

   To avoid problems with the year 2000, notes-mode assumes  that any
two-digit years before "70" are 20xx, not 19xx.  Notes-mode should
therefore work correctly in both the year 1999 and 2000.

   (Notes-mode 1.17 released February 1999 fixes a lingering Y2K
problem.)

   Because notes-mode uses seconds-since-1970 for some date calculations
it will fail beyond the year 2038 on computers with 32-bit integers.

   If I'm still using notes-mode then on a 32-bit machine I'll see what
I can do.

1.6 Related work
================

What would a document be without related work?

   Notes-mode is not related in any way to Lotus Notes.

   I am told (by David Weisman)  that it's something like the now
defunct Lotus Agenda.

   Ashvin Goel, one of the contributors to notes-mode,  has gone off
and done a from-scratch reimplementation  called records-mode.  It's
very similar to notes mode,  and emphasizes on-the-fly updates to entry
links  but lacks a manual.  You may want to check it out at
`http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~ashvin/software.html'.

   Hyperbole (by Bob Weiner) offers better linking facilities than
notes-mode, but it has a bunch of stuff notes-mode doesn't need and
it's missing notes-specific indexing provided by notes-mode.  For
people already using Hyperbole  it would be interesting to replace
notes-mode's linking  with Hyperbole's.  Contributions in this area are
welcome, provided they make Hyperbole  optional.

All you need to use notes-mode  in a chapter.  (Except for
installation, *Note Installation::.)

* Menu:

* Getting started::
* A notes file::
* The notes index::
* The notes directories::


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Getting started,  Next: A notes file,  Prev: Basics,  Up: Basics

2.1 Getting started
===================

To get started with notes-mode,  read the introduction this chapter,
then either:

   * Start emacs, do  `M-x' `load-library' `RET' `notes-mode' `RET'
     This approach will set up notes-mode with the default parameters.

   * OR, from the shell,  run the program `notesinit'.  This approach
     will ask you some questions about how you want to configure  notes
     mode.


   Either way these should set up everything notes-mode needs.  This
program will modify your environment (as described in this section),
or it will give you the exact commands you should run yourself.

   After you've done one of these,  start up emacs and note-away.  I
usually begin a  day of note-taking by running the command  `M-x'
`notes-index-todays-link'  to jump directly to today's note.  You may
even wish to bind this to something,  perhaps with  `(define-key
global-map "\C-cn" 'notes-index-todays-link)'  in your `.emacs'.

   If you want to browse your existing notes,  you might instead want
to edit the  `~/NOTES/index'.  (What is a notes file and the index?
Hurry up and finish  reading this chapter.)


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: A notes file,  Next: The notes index,  Prev: Getting started,  Up: Basics

2.2 A notes file
================

The notes file is the focus of most of the activity in notes-mode,
it's where you take your notes.  Notes files are mostly free-form text
broken up into "entries".  Here's an example:

     8-Jun-95 Thursday
     -----------------

     * Today
     -------
     prev: <none>
     next: <file:///~/NOTES/199506/950609#* Today>

     next week - release notes-mode


     * Environment/notes
     -------------------

     I explained notes mode to Ashvin and Geoff.
     ...

   Each entry has a subject-block, (maybe) some links, and then (maybe)
some text.

   The subject-block must begin with an asterisk-space (`* ')  at the
beginning of a line, followed by the subject itself.  Subjects must be
underlined with a row of dashes  (if they're not exact, that's OK;
notes-mode will fix them periodically).  For convenience,  notes-mode
will automatically add the underlines when you  hit `<RTN>'
(`notes-electric-return'),  and `<TAB>' on a partially completed
subject will  invoke completion based on indexed subjects
(`notes-complete-subject').  

   Following the subject may be links.  (In the example, the "Today"
entry has links,  the "Environment/notes" entry doesn't.)  These links
will be automatically updated by notes-mode  when your notes are
re-indexed;  just leave a blank line when writing the note.  

   Links are made with pseudo-URLs,  sort of like those in the World
Wide Web.  Any of these URLs can be followed in notes-mode files  by
clicking `S-mouse-2' on the pseudo-URL  (`notes-w3-follow-link-mouse').  

   Finally comes the text.  Go wild, but just don't include text that
looks like a subject.  You can embed pseudo-URLs to link notes together
manually.

   The more anal of you may have noticed  that the lines before the
first subject  are not part of any entry.  These lines are  "front
matter".  They're not usually used for much,  but they can be a good
place to label the file.  

   There are a number of useful conventions  that can be adopted to
organize your notes.  The most common is the "Today" entry.  If you
keep an entry with the same subject  at the beginning of each file,
you link all of your notes together.  Notes-mode will help you out with
some of these convetions  by automatically creating or copying some
fields for you;  see *note Useful conventions:: for details.

   Finally, notes-mode can also work with outline-minor-mode  (thanks
to Tim Carroll for pointing this out).  Outline-mode supports hiding
and revealing text and other helpful  features beyond the scope of this
document.  *Note Outline Mode: (emacs)Outline Mode, for details.


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: The notes index,  Next: The notes directories,  Prev: A notes file,  Up: Basics

2.3 The notes index
===================

The notes index lists all subjects you've kept notes about,  and each
date of each note.  Impress your friends,  show your advisor why you're
worth the _big_ peanuts,  you'll soon have the biggest index of all.

   The index has one line per subject, listing the subject  and each
day a note was made about that subject.  For example:

     Bicycle: 950314, 950316
     Bicycle/maintenance/books: 951028
     Bridge/hands: 951113, 951114, 951116, 951117
     Bridge/UCLA: 960222, 960409

   Clicking on any of the dates with `mouse-2'  will take you to that
note  (`notes-index-mouse-follow-link').  (You can also move the point
over the date and hit `<RTN>'  if you're musaphobic
[`notes-index-follow-link'].)  

   The notes index is automatically updated by the program `mkall'.
Typically `mkall' is run nightly by `cron'.  On most modern versions of
Unix, you can add this command to cron by  running `crontab -e' and
adding the line:

     0 4 * * * /usr/local/lib/notes-mode/mkall
   
   (Assuming that your notes programs are installed  in
/usr/local/lib/notes-mode, the default location.)


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: The notes directories,  Prev: The notes index,  Up: Basics

2.4 The notes directories
=========================

The final thing needed to tie basic notes-mode together his how the
pieces fit together.  Since my graduate work is in file systems, you
can bet that directories are involved.

   Notes-mode keeps its files in a two-level hierarchy:

     ~/NOTES
     ~/NOTES/index
     ~/NOTES/rawindex
     ~/NOTES/199603
     ~/NOTES/199603/960329
     ~/NOTES/199603/960330
     ~/NOTES/199604
     ~/NOTES/199604/960401

   The top level, `~/NOTES', is the notes directory.  It keeps all
notes in one place.  (The name of this directory is configurable, *Note
Notes-mode configuration::.)

   Inside the notes directory are two files and a number of directories.
The files are `index',  the index of all entries (*note The notes
index::),  and `rawindex',  used internally.  

   The notes directory also contains a number of subdirectories,
sometimes called "intermediate directories".  These directories group
the actual notes files into manageable chunks,  keeping any directory
from getting too large.  Intermediate directories are named  by the
four-digit year and the two-digit month  of the entries they contain.
(The format of intermediate directories  is configurable, *Note
Notes-mode configuration::.)  

   Finally,  in each intermediate directory are the notes files
themselves,  named according to the two-digit year, month, and
day-of-month.  

   For the most part,  notes-mode will automatically maintain this
organization of files,  once you create the top-level directory.
Notes-mode will also automatically ensure  that all files in the notes
directory are unreadable by  anyone other than their owner.  Notes are
personal things.  (This behavior is not currently configurable,  but it
probably should be.)

File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Getting around,  Next: Subject summary,  Prev: Notes files,  Up: Notes files

3.1.1 Getting around
--------------------

Moving between notes entries and around the hierarchy is fairly common,
so there are some accelerators.

`C-c C-i'
     Jump to the index entry for the current entry's subject
     (`notes-goto-index-entry').  

`C-c C-n'

`C-c C-p'
     Move to the next or prior note with the same subject
     (`notes-follow-next-link' and `notes-follow-prev-link').  These
     functions follow the links in the note,  if they're defined.  If
     not,  they look through the index file.  This approach usually
     works,  but will fail if there are multiple new entries created
     with the given subject  between when the index is recomputed.  

`C-c<RTN>'
     Follow the link under the point (`notes-w3-follow-link'),  a
     keyboard equivalent of <S-mouse-2>.  

`M-C-a'

`M-C-e'
     Jump to the beginning or end of the current note entry
     (`notes-beginning-of-defun' and `notes-end-of-defun').  

`C-c C-k'
     Copies the pseudo-URL for the current note into the kill-ring
     (`current-url-as-kill').  To link two entries, go to the target,
     grab its URL with `C-c C-k',  go to where you want to make the
     link,  and yank the URL with `C-y'.  


   Notes mode supports imenu,  if you have it bound to something  (I
use `(global-set-key [down-mouse-3] 'imenu)').  


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Subject summary,  Next: Encryption,  Prev: Getting around,  Up: Notes files

3.1.2 Subject summary
---------------------

It's often helpful to look at all  entries for a given subject `C-c C-s'
collects all entries with the subject of the current  entry in a new
buffer  (`notes-summarize-subject').  


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Encryption,  Next: Useful conventions,  Prev: Subject summary,  Up: Notes files

3.1.3 Encryption
----------------

Notes occasionally contain private material.  While Unix has strong
services for file protection  (compared to other, say, more
wide-selling operating systems),  in many systems root passwords are
shared,  while other systems are vulnerable to physical compromise.  In
such systems,  properly used encryption is the best approach to
security.

   Notes-mode encryption is based  Phill Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) (see `http://www.mantis.co.uk/pgp/pgp.html')  and either  with
Rick Campbell's  emacs interface, PAM (PGP Augmented Messaging) (from
`ftp://h.gp.cs.cmu.edu/usr/rfb/pam/')  (note that as of January 1997,
PAM is no longer at this ftp site  and appears to not be publicly
available),  or LoPresti and Choi's mailcrypt (from
`http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/mailcrypt/').  

`C-c C-e'
     Encrypt the current note (`notes-encrypt-note').  By default this
     function encrypts the whole entry.  With a prefix argument,  only
     the part from the point to the end of the entry is encrypted.  

`C-c C-d'
     Decrypt the current note (`notes-decrypt-note').
   
   By default notes-mode determines your public key by looking  up your
`user-full-name' in your PGP keyring.  You can override this default by
setting  `notes-encryption-key-id'  to the desired key-id.  


File: notes-mode.info,  Node: Useful conventions,  Prev: Encryption,  Up: Notes files

3.1.4 Useful conventions
------------------------

There are a number of conventions which can make notes-mode  easier to
use.  These conventions are a matter of personal taste,  of course.  Do
what works for you.

   First,  I find it helpful to keep the date of each notes-file at the
top  of the file.  This makes the file self-identifying  if the
filename is lost.

   Second,  I find it useful to have the first entry of each file  have
the same subject (perhaps "Today").  This entry then links all notes
together,  making it easy to go to yesterday and tomorrow.  I keep a
to-do list on this entry,  bringing the list forward each day.  

   A third useful convention is to keep an  entry with the name based
on the day of the week  in each file.  Analogous to "Today", this entry
links together  weeks.

   Notes-mode supports these conventions.  When you make a new
notes-file in emacs,  notes-mode searches for the preceding file.  If
it follows any of these conventions,  the new file is initialized
appropriately.  Currently  the approach to do this process  (in the
program `mknew')  is fairly sensitive,  so it may not work in all cases.
In particular,  the date convention works only on  for English-language
dates.  (If you use notes-mode with a non-English language,  let me
know and I'll work with you to fix this limitation.)

   If you find other helpful conventions,  please let me know.
Modifications to `mknew' to implement  new conventions are also invited.

   If you don't want to use these conventions,  or if you want to use
different ones,  set the emacs variable
notes-mode-initialization-program  to nil or the name of your
initialization program.

3.2 Notes indices
=================

Only two features of notes index mode haven't yet been described.
First,  you can open any notes-file based on date  with
`notes-index-link',  normally bound to <o>.  

   Second,  you can get a subject-summary  with <C-c C-s>  (*note
Subject summary::).  The subject defaults to that of the current index
line.

3.3 Notes-mode configuration
============================

Several aspects of notes mode are particularly visible  to the user.
Because I'm not a fascist,  a user can change most of these.

   Preferences are specified in `~/.notesrc'.  This file lists things
to change:

     # lines beginning with a hash are comments
     dir: ~/NOTES
     int_form: %Y%m

   Currently, two things can be changed:

`dir'
     Specifies the root of the notes directory hierarchy  (*note The
     notes directories::).

`int_form'
     Specifies the form of the intermediate directory.  A limited
     subset of `strftime(3)'  formatting is allowed.

   The subset of `strftime(3)' supported in `int_form' is:
`%Y'
     The four-digit year.

`%y'
     The two-digit year.

`%m'
     A two-digit numeric month.

`%d'
     A two-digit day.

   In addition to `.notesrc',  there are a number of emacs-specific
variables.  These variables are documented in the file
`notes-variables.el'.

4.1 Notes-mode history
======================

Briefly,  I started keeping notes on-line shortly after I got a
portable computer  in January, 1994.  After a month-and-a-half of
notes, I realized that  one does not live by grep alone,  so I started
adding indexing facilities.

   In June of 1995  some other Ficus-project members started  keeping
and indexing on-line notes  using other home-grown systems.  After some
discussion,  we generalized my notes-mode work and  they started using
it.

   Over the next 18 months notes-mode grew.  Finally, in April, 1996 I
wrote documentation,  guaranteeing that innovation on notes-mode will
now cease  or the documentation will become out of date.

4.2 Credits
===========

I (John Heidemann, <johnh@isi.edu>)  started, documented, and currently
maintain notes-mode.  I take ultimate responsibility for the code,
especially for the ugly parts that I won't let others change.

   Ashvin Goel  <ashvin@ficus.cs.ucla.edu>  has been a very
enthusiastic notes-mode user and contributor.  He is responsible for at
least  the ideas behind `notes-summarize-subject' and the ideas and
initial implementations of  some of the original generalization and
modularity improvements,  `notes-follow-next-link' and
`notes-follow-prev-link',  `notes-goto-index-entry',  programmed
subject completion,  and  context-sensitive mouse-2 handling.  In
addition,  he is an invaluable second opinion about  what and how
things should be done  (even if I don't always agree with him).

   Geoff Kuenning  <geoff@ficus.cs.ucla.edu>  has been another
enthusiastic notes-mode user and victim.  He is responsible for
finding several bugs,  motivation for mouse-less operation,  comments
about the documentation,  the day-of-week convention,  and an initial
implementation and the idea of  multiple entries with the same subjects
in a single notes-file.

   Ramesh Govindan <govindan@isi.edu> did the xemacs port.

   Since it's release on Usenet in April 1996 several  other folks have
contributed.  Thanks to  David Weisman <weisman@app1.osf.org>,  Martin
L. Smith <martin@ner.com>,  Jason Bastek <jason@aai.com>,  Ulrich
Herbst <Ulrich.Herbst@t-systems.com>.  See the next section (*Note
Changes::.) for details of their exploits.

   Thanks to Larry Ayers <layers@marktwain.net>  for popularizing
notes-mode with reviews in  the Linux Gazette  (at
<http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue22/notes-mode.html> and
<http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue35/ayers.html>).

4.3 Changes
===========

For the bored:

   First semi-public release. 12-Jul-95: version 0.1  Shared a version
with Ashvin and Geoff.

   Changed  6-Dec-95: version 0.3  Ashvin's changes for note traversal
added (C-c C-p and C-c C-n now move to the prev/next note in note-mode).
URL parsing changed so that "localhost" is optional.

   Changed 19-Dec-95:  version 0.4  More robust prev/next code added,
both to handle going back and forward in the middle of chains through
the index file, and to handle back/forward in a single file.   URL
parsing changed so that notes-goto-index-entry correctly handles
lookups on notes names such as "252A".

   Changed 20-Dec-95: version 0.5.   Fixed a missing variable in
notes-url.el.   Added a work-around to a bug in emacs-19.30's
define-derived-mode.

   Changed 24-Dec-95: version 0.6.   Prev/next code re-re-written to be
more robust.

   Changed 26-Dec-96:  version 0.7.   Bug fix release.

   Changed 23-Jan-96: version 0.8.   Initialization code added to set
up a new note.  New variable:  notes-bin-dir.

   I'm skipping version 0.9 because I erroneously release version 0.1
as version 0.9 (only on the web, not on Usenet).

   I'm bumping from version "0" to version "1" since the code is has
been in production use for more than a year by several people.  Minor
numbers are the same.

   Changed 26-Mar-96: version 1.10.   Setup code completely re-written.
Several incompatible changes have been made:  - the lisp and Perl code
must be installed via make install, not by copying.   - some data is
specified in a .notesrc file; copy and modify sample.notesrc.   -
several internal elisp changes.   - catsubject added (bound to C-cC-s):
collect all notes about the current subject.   - new notes-files are
initialized with fields based on the prior day's notes; see mknew for
details.   - daily_work is gone; mkall is rewritten to use .notesrc.

   Changed 29-Apr-96: version 1.11.   Real documentation.   Mknew
caching added.

   Changed  9-Aug-96: version 1.12.   Added notesinit to do all setup
for new users.

   Changed 24-Aug-96: version 1.13.   Minor documentation fixes.

   Changed 20-Dec-97: version 1.14.  Autoconf support.

   Fontification of the index buffer is now pre-computed in perl other
than done when the file is needed (in elisp with slow regular
expressions).  2000-line index files are now 1-2 seconds rather than
15-30 on a 100MHz Pentium.  If necessary (the pre-computed version
isn't up-to-date) we fall back on the slower code.

   Related work improved (suggestion by David Weisman
<weisman@app1.osf.org>).

   Documentation improvement (problem found by Martin L. Smith
<martin@ner.com>).

   Installation improved (code by Jason Bastek <jason@aai.com>).

   Bug in notes-index mode with subjects containing colons fixed
(johnh).

   Encryption now supports mailcrypt.el.

   Support for emacs 20 (a small font-lock change).

   Changed  5-Jan-98: version 1.15.  Bug in decryption for non-PAM
users fixed  (suggestion by Kevin Davidson <tkld@quadstone.com>).

   Y2K statement added  (suggestion by Kevin Davidson
<tkld@quadstone.com>).

   Pointer to mailcrypt added (as a supported encryption package).
Problem pointed out by K. Ueda <kueda@jupiter.qse.tohoku.ac.jp>.

   Changed  4-Nov-98: version 1.16.  Bug in kill-ring handling of
notes-old-underline-line  fixed by Tim Potter <timp@jna.com.au>.  Bug
in whitespace handling after PGP encryption fixed by Tim Potter.  Bugs
in handling of entries with hash signs in their name fixed  (found by
Tim Potter).  Fontification of index buffer further improved  (mapcar
is your friend).  Xemacs support added based on code contributed by
Ramesh Govindan.

   Changed 28-Feb-99: version 1.17: Improvement:  notes-electric-return
now fixes up the prev/next links  of new entries (only).  Code
contributed by  Takashi Nishimoto.

   Bug fix:  reversed options -batch and -q in configure.in to placate
XEmacs 20.0; changed notesinit to not downcase the pathname  (bugs
found by Thierry Bezecourt).

   Clarification: Autofilling of new notes more clear in the manual
(hopefully,  suggested by Solofo Ramangalahy).

   Bug fix:  a y2k bug in was found and fixed in mkindex.  Sigh.

   New:  Two mailing lists for notes-mode have been created:
`notes-mode-announce@heidemann.la.ca.us' and
`notes-mode-talk@heidemann.la.ca.us'.  Send the line "subscribe
notes-mode-announce" (or "subscribe notes-mode-talk") to
`majordomo@heidemann.la.ca.us' to join them.  [_These instructions are
now superceeded; to subscribe, go to
`http://www.heidemann.la.ca.us/mailman/listinfo/notes-mode-talk' and
`http://www.heidemann.la.ca.us/mailman/listinfo/notes-mode-announce'._]

   Changed  6-Oct-99: version 1.18: Bug fix:  handling of
electric-prevnext is better when there are  existing prev/next links.

   Clarification: I added some pointers in the code to the installation
instructions.  (Apparently people can't RTF README.)

   Extension: mailcrypt-3.5.x suported including pgp, pgp5 and gpg.

   Changed (date 23-Dec-00): version 1.19: Bug fix (cosmetic): suppress
comments in encrypted nodes.

   Install fixes from Kannan Varadhan: elisp directories changed on
install.

   Added C-j as a synonym for RET in notes-mode to parallel C++ or perl
mode.  (Suggested by Fred Jaggi `jaggi@rsn.hp.com'.)

   Outline-minor-mode support added and documented.  (Suggested by Tim
Carroll `tim@boomboom.com'.)

   Bug/typo fixes in gpg support (Contributed by William A. Perkins
`wa_perkins@pnl.gov', with separate patches from Knut Anders Hatlen
`kahatlen@online.no'.)

   Installation improvements suggested by Christophe Troestler
`Ch.Troestler@linkline.be': use install-info to update the info dir,
warn users of -prefix that lisp files go elsewhere.

   Changed (date  1-Feb-01): version 1.20: Bug fix: missing file
notes-first.el added to the distribution.  (Bug found by Michael
Totschnig `michaelt@supernet.ca'.)

   Changed ( 5-Dec-01): version 1.21: (backed-out--didn't work with
spaced URLs) URL lookup now uses thing-at-point.

   Fix to make notes-mode work with emacs-21.1 (Fix from Klaus Zeitler
`kzeitler@lucent.com'.)

   Changed ( 3-Jan-02): version 1.22: Several bugs in `notesinit' for
stricter Perl implementations (bug found by Paul Craven"
`pcraven@yorku.ca', and Kasper van Wijk `kasper@acoustics.mines.edu')
and to make it run cleanly more often.

   Notes-first now autoinitializes notes mode from emacs.  (As
instisted by rms, unfortunately about two years later than requested.)

   Changed (20-Feb-05): version 1.23: Outline mode is now forcebly
turned on to avoid interactions with user's text-mode hooks (bug and
fix from Nils Ackermann `nils@nieback.de').

   Install bug involving ordering of scripts and byte-compilation fixed
(bug and fix from Mark Allman `mallman@grc.nasa.gov').

   Fix obscure bug in configure, reported by Klaus Zeitler
`kzeitler@lucent.com'.

   Fix for notes-summarize-subject when no subject is specified (bug
and fix from Geoff Kuenning).

   Changed (14-Jan-06): version 1.24:

   install-info bug documented with the Debian install-info (bug
reported by Aaron Falk `falk@isi.edu').

   Automatic date completion in new days is now done in the current
locale, so it should now work for non-English languages.  Bug reported
by Torsten Bronger `bronger@physik.rwth-aachen.de'.

   Fixed a bug in mkindexcache, triggered by subjects with percent signs
in them.  Bug reported by Philip Austin `paustin@eos.ubc.ca'.

   We're a bit more robust about subjects, I hope.  Warnings should
appear about embedded number signs, and leading spaces should be
filtered.  Bug reported by Philip Austin `paustin@eos.ubc.ca'.

   Notes-mode now dervies from indented-text-mode rather than
paragraph-indent-text mode.  Unfortunatley this is not customizable
because of limitations of define-derived-mode.  Change suggested by
Aaron Falk `falk@isi.edu'.

   Provide better hints about how to get started after installation or
running notes-mode in emacs for the first time.

   In notes init, the default path for dir was the full path, not the
tilde version of the path.  Now it defaults to using tidle for home
directory.  Bug reported by Mark Allman `allman@icir.org'.

   Changed (26-May-06): version 1.25:

   fixed a bug in the release tar.gz file that had a additional copies
copy nested.

   Changed (30-Jun-08): version 1.26:

   Force unicode I/O in `mkindexcache' to fix highlighting mis-alignment
when using emacs-21 with unicode subject lines.

   Changed mkprevnext and mkrawindex to optionally take the list of
notes files to index from stdin rather than from the command line.
Yes, I finally have 4093 notes files, overflowing the Unix command line
buffer.

   Changes notes-mode.el to put path in quotes, allowing spaces to
appear in home directory names (bug fix from Ulrich Herbst).

   Added a suggested features section.

   Changed ( 8-Aug-08): version 1.27:

   Change I/O in `mkindexcache' to use locale (the sadly correct thing)
rather than forcing utf-8 (the Righteous Path).  Bug report from Geoff
Kuenning, a man with an older Unix environment than I.

   Changed (20-Jun-10): version 1.28:

   Changed a regular expression in `notes-index-mode.el' that was
causing emacs-v23 (a pre-release version) to regular expression
infinite recursion.

   Changed (2012-04-04): version 1.29

   (2011-08-23) Changed `run-hooks' to `run-mode-hooks'.  Bug report
from Geoff Kuenning.

   Changed some handling of PGP encryption to account for some apparent
API changes.

   (2012-04-04) Fixed encyrption to handle encrypting empty notes at
the end of buffers without going into an infinite loop.  Clearly wrong
code, but you have to ask this guy for why he tried: Bug report from
Geoff Kuenning.

4.4 Suggested features
======================

Features suggested by users but not yet implemented:

   21-Feb-08: (from Xavier Maillard): should support "disconnected"
notes that are indexed but not date-based.

   21-Feb-08: (from John Heidemann): should switch all notes files to
have an extension (maybe `.notes').

5 Installation
**************

To install notes-mode,

  1. Unpack and extract the distribution (gunzip notes-mode-xxx.tar.gz;
     tar xvf notes-mode-xxx.tar; cd notes-mode-xxx).

  2. Run configure (./configure).

  3. Type "make install".

   (To control what's installed where, use -prefix=/where, or
-with-lisp-dir=/where, -datadir=/where (for scripts), and
-infodir=/where.)

   For each user:
  1. Run notesinit

   If you have problems with paths being incorrect, please be aware that
you _cannot_ run notes directly out of where you untar it.  The
installation process customizes the programs for where things are on
your system.  Make sure you move out of the directory where you
untarred it before running it.

   The most recent distribution of notes-mode  is always available via
`http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/NOTES_MODE/'.
